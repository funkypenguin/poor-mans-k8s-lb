# What is funkypenguin/poor-mans-k8s-lb ?

This is a simple Docker container designed to be included in a Kubernetes pod. Its only purpose is to make an outbound HTTP/HTTPS call to a webhook, on a host configured for haproxy. The haproxy host will then be aware of the pod's host's IP address, and auto-configure haproxy to send traffic to it.

# How do I use this?
